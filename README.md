# Cryptography

This repository contains scripts written in Scala for cryptography labs in the Practical Computer Science course. The scripts can be run using the scala-cli tool. Please note that the script names may not be ideal, but they are imposed by the course instructor.

### [Caesar](caesar)  
This script can be used to perform operations using the Caesar cipher or the affine cipher. 

### [XOR](xor)
This script demonstrates that using a one-time pad more than once enables the cipher to be broken.
